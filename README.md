This is a Google Earth Engine (GEE) repository.
Here are some pieces of code that I came up for dealing with some of the most basic problems one encounters when using GEE Python API.
Most of this code is currently in use. So most of it is tested, but of course it comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY. :)
Any help is greatly appreciated.

Here is my GEE Crash Course https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pdON9_74k3-KRH2-N3LG3h7SIrLBTbV-rutkxSO5T2c/edit?usp=sharing
